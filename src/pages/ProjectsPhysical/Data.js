        Gardening and growing my own food brings me an incredible amount of joy. I also love automating things. So I
        built a weather forecast controlled watering system that always ensures my plants get the right amount of water.
        <br />
        <br />
        To help my seeds grow during the cold Cape Town winter I also build a temperature controlled seedling box.

        My grandfather was a carpenter and started large timber door factory. I used walk through the factory with him
        and he taught me how to work with wood. I love the smell of freshly cut wood and the feeling of creating
        something with my hands. I hope that one day have a small furniture making business of my own.
        <br />
        <br />
        My most recent projects include a set of 3 couches built out of pallets, a tv stand with hidden wheels, a
        standing desk and a set of wooden bowls.

        Given the rate of inflation, maintaining my fruit juice addition became rather expensive. So I thought why not
        start my own small juice company! <br />
        <br /> It wasn't wildly successful but the it broken even and I got to drink as much juice as I wanted!
